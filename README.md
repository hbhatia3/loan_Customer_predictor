# Personal Loan Customer Identification for Bank

#### Use case : The management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns to better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget.

#### The department wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign.

#### EDA of the customer data and model building with hyperparameter tunning can be found in the Jupyter Notebook. More details on the different stages of project can be learned from the attached presentation.

#### This project was implemented end-to-end with deployment of the best performing model (Gradient Boosting Classifier with 0.988 accuracy and 0.96 recall) in AWS EC2 instance. One can interact with the model using the link given below -
